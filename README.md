ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Afnan Khan. I am a passionate self taught Front-End Developer with experience in Graphic Design.

I am knowledgeable in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have learnt a couple of frameworks such as ReactJS (+Typescript), NextJS and have begun learning SASS for styling. On top of that I also have experience creatively, working with programs such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and InDesign.
